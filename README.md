## Project Title: Explore U.S Bikeshare Data
###### Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. In this project, we will uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
#### 
#### Installation Instructions
###### You will be executing bikeshare.py file in the terminal on your computer in this lesson. You need to have Python installed on your computer to execute this script. We recommend installing Python 3                                 
####  
#### Common Usage
###### The bikeshare.py file is set up as an interactive experience because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions below will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. _Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?_
2. _Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?_
3. _(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?_
4. _(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?_
###### The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe of the statistical result of the data, and you can choose to start again or exit.
