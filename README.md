## Project Title: Explore U.S Bikeshare Data
###### Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. In this project, we will uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
##### Files used: 
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv

###### _We would like to thank Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States_
